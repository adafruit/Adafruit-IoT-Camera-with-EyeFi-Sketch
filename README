This is an Arduino sketch for using the Adafruit TTL Serial JPEG Cameras with an Eye-Fi card for wireless snaps.

To download, click the ZIP button below. Decompress the archive, rename the resulting folder to Adafruit_EyeFi and place it in your Arduino sketchbook folder. Restart the Arduino IDE, and the sketch should be available from the Sketchbook menu.

Also requires the VC0706 Serial Camera Library and RTClib:

We highly recommend initializing the Eye-Fi card using the SdFormatter sketch included with the SdFat library:
